# UNIX Server Learning Roadmap

## **1. Introduction to UNIX Servers**

### **Understanding UNIX**
- History and evolution of UNIX.
- Differences between UNIX, Linux, and BSD.
- Common UNIX distributions (AIX, Solaris, FreeBSD, HP-UX).

### **Setting Up a UNIX Server**
- Installing a UNIX system (Bare metal, Virtual Machine, Cloud setup).
- Basic file system structure (`/etc`, `/var`, `/home`, `/bin`, etc.).
- User roles and permissions (root, sudo users, normal users).

---

## **2. UNIX Command Line Basics**

### **Basic Commands**
- Navigating directories (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`).
- File operations (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `cat`, `touch`).
- Viewing and editing files (`nano`, `vim`, `less`, `tail`).

### **File and Directory Permissions**
- Understanding permissions (`rwx`, `chmod`, `chown`).
- Setting appropriate access levels.
- Using `umask` for default permissions.

### **Process and System Management**
- Checking system status (`top`, `ps`, `uptime`).
- Managing processes (`kill`, `nice`, `nohup`).
- Scheduling tasks (`cron`, `at`).

---

## **3. Networking and Security**

### **Networking Basics**
- Checking network configuration (`ifconfig`, `ip`, `netstat`).
- Configuring network interfaces and DNS.
- Using `ping`, `traceroute`, `nslookup` for troubleshooting.

### **User Management and Security**
- Adding/removing users (`useradd`, `usermod`, `passwd`).
- Managing groups and permissions.
- Implementing SSH for secure access.

### **Firewall and Security Tools**
- Setting up a firewall (`iptables`, `ufw`).
- Hardening the server against attacks.
- Monitoring logs (`/var/log`, `syslog`, `journalctl`).

---

## **4. Server Administration and Monitoring**

### **Package Management**
- Installing and updating software (`apt`, `yum`, `pkg`).
- Managing dependencies and repositories.

### **Disk and File System Management**
- Mounting and unmounting drives.
- Checking disk usage (`df`, `du`).
- Managing partitions (`fdisk`, `mkfs`).

### **System Monitoring and Performance Tuning**
- Resource monitoring (`htop`, `iotop`, `vmstat`).
- Load balancing and performance tuning.
- Log analysis for troubleshooting.

---

## **5. Advanced UNIX Topics**

### **Shell Scripting**
- Writing basic shell scripts.
- Automating tasks with `bash` and `cron`.
- Using loops and conditional statements in scripts.

### **Backup and Recovery**
- Setting up automated backups (`rsync`, `tar`).
- Configuring remote backups and disaster recovery plans.

### **Virtualization and Containerization**
- Setting up virtualization (`KVM`, `VirtualBox`).
- Using Docker and Kubernetes for containerized applications.

### **Cloud and DevOps Integration**
- Managing UNIX servers in the cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- CI/CD integration with UNIX environments.
- Infrastructure as Code (Ansible, Terraform).

---

## **6. Building Real-World Projects**

### **Beginner Projects**
- Automating file backups with shell scripts.
- Setting up a basic web server (Apache, Nginx).

### **Intermediate Projects**
- Configuring a secure SSH-access-only server.
- Monitoring server logs and generating reports.

### **Advanced Projects**
- Implementing a high-availability UNIX server.
- Building a centralized log management system.
- Deploying a containerized microservices application.

---

## **7. Best Practices for UNIX Server Management**
- Keep software and packages up to date.
- Regularly audit logs and security settings.
- Optimize resource usage for better performance.
- Implement disaster recovery and backup strategies.

This roadmap provides a structured path to mastering UNIX server administration, from basics to advanced topics. Keep practicing by setting up your own servers and experimenting with real-world scenarios!
