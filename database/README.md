# SQL Learning Roadmap

## **1. Basics of SQL**

### **Introduction to SQL**
- What is SQL and why it is used.
- Overview of relational databases.

### **SQL Environment Setup**
- Installing and using database systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite).
- Setting up database clients (e.g., DBeaver, pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench).

### **Basic SQL Commands**
- SELECT, FROM, WHERE.
- Filtering with conditions (e.g., `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`).
- Sorting results with ORDER BY.
- Using LIMIT and OFFSET.

### **Basic Data Manipulation**
- INSERT: Adding new records to a table.
- UPDATE: Modifying existing records.
- DELETE: Removing records from a table.

## **2. Database Design and Schema**

### **Understanding Database Design**
- Tables, Rows, and Columns.
- Data Types (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE, BOOLEAN).
- Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, and Unique Constraints.

### **Creating and Modifying Tables**
- CREATE TABLE statement.
- ALTER TABLE for adding/modifying columns.
- DROP TABLE to delete a table.

### **Relationships in Databases**
- One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many.
- Implementing relationships using Foreign Keys.

## **3. Intermediate SQL**

### **Advanced SELECT Queries**
- Using DISTINCT to remove duplicates.
- Aggregation with GROUP BY.
- Aggregate Functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX.
- Filtering groups with HAVING.

### **Joins**
- INNER JOIN: Combining data from multiple tables.
- LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN.
- SELF JOIN for hierarchical data.

### **Subqueries**
- Using subqueries in SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses.
- Correlated subqueries.

### **Indexing**
- What are indexes and why they are important.
- Creating and using indexes for performance improvement.

---

## **4. Advanced SQL**

### **Views**
- Creating and using views for simplified queries.
- Updating data through views (when possible).

### **Stored Procedures and Functions**
- Writing and executing stored procedures.
- Creating custom functions for reusable logic.

### **Triggers**
- Defining triggers to automate tasks.
- Trigger use cases: Before/After INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

### **Transactions**
- ACID properties.
- Using COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.

### **Performance Optimization**
- Query execution plans.
- Index optimization.
- Avoiding common pitfalls like Cartesian joins.

---

## **5. Specific SQL Use Cases**

### **Data Analysis**
- Using window functions: ROW_NUMBER, RANK, NTILE.
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for complex queries.

### **Data Warehousing**
- Star and Snowflake schema.
- Fact and Dimension tables.

### **Database Administration**
- User management: GRANT, REVOKE, and Roles.
- Backup and Restore.
- Monitoring database performance.

### **SQL with Programming Languages**
- Connecting databases to applications (e.g., Python, Node.js).
- Using ORMs (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Django ORM).

---

## **6. SQL Best Practices**

### **Coding Standards**
- Writing readable and maintainable SQL.
- Using aliases and meaningful column/table names.

### **Error Handling**
- Handling NULL values.
- Managing exceptions in stored procedures.

### **Security**
- Avoiding SQL injection.
- Securing database access with roles and permissions.

---

## **7. Building Projects**

### Beginner Projects
- Employee management system.
- Library database.
- Simple inventory tracking.

### Intermediate Projects
- E-commerce database (products, orders, customers).
- Movie database with user reviews.
- Blog database with categories and tags.

### Advanced Projects
- Data warehouse for analytics.
- Implementing a custom recommendation system.
- Building a performance monitoring dashboard for a database.
