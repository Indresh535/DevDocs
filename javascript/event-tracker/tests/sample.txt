compare Worker Threads vs. Redis with Bull for multi-threaded processing in Node.js, I'll create two separate projects:

Worker Threads Implementation

Uses worker_threads for parallel processing.
Suitable for CPU-intensive tasks.
Direct communication via MessagePort.
Redis + Bull Implementation

Uses Bull (based on Redis) for distributed job queue processing.
More scalable for task queueing and background jobs.
Ideal for async, long-running, or distributed tasks.
