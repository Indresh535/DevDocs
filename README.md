To integrate OpenAI with your Node.js backend and answer user questions based on your Postgres database, follow my below mentioned steps:

Set up a Node.js backend.
Use the OpenAI API to generate responses.
Prepare input format for user questions.
Process user queries and send them to the OpenAI API.
Retrieve relevant data from your database based on the question.
Post-process the OpenAI response.
Combine database data with the language model’s output.
Remember, the language model won’t directly access your database; it generates responses based on its training on a vast dataset. Ensure user input security and privacy measures are in place. Training the model specifically on your database data requires significant resources and expertise in NLP and ML, so using pre-trained models like GPT-3 for language generation is recommended.
