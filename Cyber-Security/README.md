## **1. Cybersecurity Fundamentals**

### **1.1 What is Cybersecurity?**
- Protecting digital assets from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage.
- Key areas: Network Security, Application Security, Information Security, and Operational Security.

### **1.2 Cybersecurity Principles**
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring only authorized access to information.
- **Integrity**: Ensuring data remains unaltered and trustworthy.
- **Availability**: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Validating user identity and permissions.

## **2. Cyber Threats and Attacks**

### **2.1 Types of Cyber Attacks**
- **Phishing**: Fraudulent emails to steal sensitive information.
- **Malware**: Viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) & Distributed DoS (DDoS)**: Overloading systems to cause downtime.
- **SQL Injection**: Exploiting database vulnerabilities.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Intercepting communications.
- **Zero-Day Attacks**: Exploiting unknown vulnerabilities.

### **2.2 Common Security Vulnerabilities**
- Weak passwords
- Unpatched software
- Misconfigured systems
- Insider threats

- **Secure Boot**: Ensure only trusted OS and software load.

### **3.3 Web & Application Security**
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Prevent vulnerabilities like SQL Injection & XSS.
- **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**: Protect against web-based attacks.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevent cross-site scripting (XSS).

### **3.4 Identity & Access Management (IAM)**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enhancing authentication security.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Restrict access based on roles.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Centralized authentication.

### **3.5 Cryptography**
- **Encryption Algorithms**: AES, RSA, ECC.
- **Hashing**: MD5, SHA-256.
- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: Secure communication.
