# Ansible Learning Roadmap

## **1. Introduction to Ansible**

### **What is Ansible?**
- Overview of Ansible and its use cases.
- Difference between Ansible and other configuration management tools.
- Understanding Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

### **Installing Ansible**
- Installing Ansible on Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL).
- Setting up Ansible control nodes and managed nodes.
- Testing the installation (`ansible --version`).

---

## **2. Ansible Basics**

### **Understanding Inventory**
- Defining inventory files.
- Managing groups and hosts.
- Using dynamic inventory.

### **Ansible Ad-hoc Commands**
- Running basic commands (`ansible all -m ping`).
- Copying files, managing users, and installing packages.
- Using Ansible modules (`command`, `shell`, `copy`, `yum`, `apt`).

### **Working with Playbooks**
- Introduction to YAML syntax.
- Writing a basic Ansible Playbook.
- Running Playbooks (`ansible-playbook playbook.yml`).

---

## **3. Advanced Ansible Concepts**

### **Roles and Best Practices**
- Creating and structuring Ansible roles.
- Using Ansible Galaxy.
- Implementing reusable roles.

### **Variables and Templates**
- Defining and using variables.
- Working with Jinja2 templates.
- Using `vars`, `vars_files`, and `host_vars`.

### **Handlers and Task Control**
- Creating and using handlers.
- Controlling task execution with `when`, `loop`, `block`, and `tags`.

---

## **4. Managing Infrastructure with Ansible**

### **Configuration Management**
- Managing users, groups, and permissions.
- Installing and configuring services (Nginx, Apache, MySQL, etc.).
- Handling file management and permissions.

### **Security and Compliance**
- Using `ansible-vault` for sensitive data.
- Implementing security hardening.
- Managing firewall rules and SSH access.

### **Networking and Cloud Integration**
- Managing network configurations.
- Deploying infrastructure on AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- Using cloud modules (`ec2`, `azure_rm`, `gcp_compute`).

---

## **5. Ansible Automation and Optimization**

### **Optimizing Playbooks**
- Using `async` and `poll` for performance.
- Reducing execution time with fact caching.
- Implementing Ansible callbacks and logging.

### **CI/CD with Ansible**
- Integrating Ansible with Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and GitHub Actions.
- Automating deployments with Ansible.
- Implementing Ansible in a DevOps pipeline.

---

## **6. Real-World Ansible Projects**

### **Beginner Projects**
- Automating system updates and patches.
- Setting up a basic LAMP/LEMP stack.

### **Intermediate Projects**
- Deploying a Kubernetes cluster with Ansible.
- Managing Docker containers with Ansible.

### **Advanced Projects**
- Implementing a full-scale cloud infrastructure.
- Automating security compliance checks.
- Managing multi-node high-availability setups.

---

## **7. Best Practices for Ansible**
- Follow directory structure and role-based organization.
- Use version control (Git) for playbooks.
- Implement error handling and debugging strategies.
- Optimize execution time with parallelism and efficient module usage.

This roadmap provides a structured guide to mastering Ansible, from basic automation to advanced infrastructure management. Happy learning! ðŸš€
