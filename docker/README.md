# Docker Learning Roadmap

## **1. Introduction to Docker**

### **Understanding Docker**
- What is Docker?
- Difference between Docker and Virtual Machines.
- Benefits of using Docker.
- Key Docker concepts (Images, Containers, Volumes, Networks).

### **Installing Docker**
- Installing Docker on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Understanding Docker Desktop and Docker Engine.
- Running your first container (`hello-world`).

---

## **2. Docker Basics**

### **Working with Docker Containers**
- Running and managing containers (`docker run`, `docker ps`, `docker stop`).
- Removing containers (`docker rm`).
- Viewing container logs (`docker logs`).

### **Understanding Docker Images**
- Pulling images from Docker Hub (`docker pull`).
- Listing and removing images (`docker images`, `docker rmi`).
- Creating a custom image using `Dockerfile`.

### **Networking and Storage**
- Managing Docker networks (`docker network create`, `docker network ls`).
- Persistent storage with Docker volumes (`docker volume create`).

---

## **3. Advanced Docker Concepts**

### **Building and Managing Docker Images**
- Writing a `Dockerfile`.
- Building an image (`docker build`).
- Tagging and pushing images to Docker Hub.

### **Docker Compose**
- Understanding `docker-compose.yml`.
- Defining multi-container applications.
- Running services with `docker-compose up`.

### **Docker Networking**
- Bridge, host, and overlay networks.
- Connecting multiple containers.

---

## **4. Docker in Production**

### **Optimizing Docker Images**
- Reducing image size with multi-stage builds.
- Using `.dockerignore` for efficient builds.

### **Security Best Practices**
- Running containers as non-root users.
- Scanning images for vulnerabilities.
- Managing secrets in Docker.

### **Monitoring and Logging**
- Monitoring containers (`docker stats`).
- Logging strategies (`docker logs`, `ELK stack`).

---

## **5. Container Orchestration**

### **Docker Swarm**
- Understanding Swarm mode.
- Creating a Swarm cluster.
- Deploying services with Swarm.

### **Kubernetes**
- Introduction to Kubernetes.
- Running Docker containers on Kubernetes.
- Managing deployments with `kubectl`.

---

## **6. Real-World Docker Projects**

### **Beginner Projects**
- Running a simple web application in Docker.
- Using Docker volumes for data persistence.

### **Intermediate Projects**
- Deploying a multi-container application with Docker Compose.
- Setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Docker.

### **Advanced Projects**
- Deploying a production-ready application with Kubernetes.
- Implementing a monitoring system for Docker containers.

---

## **7. Best Practices for Docker**
- Keep images lightweight and optimized.
- Use environment variables for configuration.
- Implement logging and monitoring.
- Regularly update and scan images for security.

This roadmap provides a structured guide to mastering Docker, from basic containerization to advanced orchestration techniques. Happy learning! ðŸš€
